🚀 Project Description: NASA APOD ETL Pipeline Using Apache Airflow, Docker, and PostgreSQL
📌 Overview:

This ETL pipeline is designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API into a PostgreSQL database using Apache Airflow. The entire pipeline runs in a Dockerized environment, ensuring scalability and ease of deployment.
🔹 Project Workflow (ETL Pipeline)
1️⃣ Extract:

    Fetches data from NASA’s APOD API using the SimpleHttpOperator.
    The API provides information about the astronomy picture of the day, including title, explanation, media type, and URL.
    The API key is securely stored in Airflow’s connection manager (nasa_api).

2️⃣ Transform:

    Filters and extracts only the necessary fields:
        title
        explanation
        url
        date
        media_type
    Handles missing values by ensuring empty strings as defaults.

3️⃣ Load:

    Uses PostgresHook to connect to PostgreSQL.
    Creates the apod_data table if it does not exist.
    Inserts the cleaned data into the database.

🔹 Key Technologies Used

    Apache Airflow → Manages ETL workflow & scheduling.
    PostgreSQL → Stores the extracted NASA APOD data.
    Docker → Containerizes the Airflow environment for easy deployment.
    Python → Implements data transformation & pipeline logic.

🔹 Why This Project is Valuable in an Interview?

    Real-world Data Engineering Use Case → Demonstrates ability to build a scalable ETL pipeline.
    Integration with REST APIs → Shows how to fetch and process external data.
    Automation & Scheduling → Proves knowledge of workflow orchestration with Airflow.
    Database Management → Highlights experience in data storage and retrieval with PostgreSQL.
    Dockerized Setup → Demonstrates skills in containerization for scalable deployment.

🔹 How to Explain It in an Interview?

💡 Example Response:
"I built an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow, Docker, and PostgreSQL to extract data from NASA’s APOD API. The pipeline follows a structured workflow: First, it ensures the database table exists, then extracts JSON data from the API, processes it to filter relevant fields, and loads the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL table. Airflow’s scheduling ensures the process runs daily, making it fully automated. The entire setup is containerized using Docker, ensuring easy deployment and scalability."
